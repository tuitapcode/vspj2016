	<a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:11">Friday's are guess what? Awesome I'm Carl Azuz</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:14">and I'll be taking you through the next ten minutes</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:16">of current events on CNN Student News.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:18">It starts with US and global stock markets.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:21">Averages have been swinging up and down wildly in 2016.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:26">Last week the Dow Jones Industrial Average got off to its worst ever start of the year.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:31">It took another dive earlier this week,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:33">but gained some of those losses back yesterday.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:36">One of the biggest reasons for the instability is fear.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:40">A popular saying is that Wall Street is governed by the emotions of fear and greed.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:45">When investors are afraid, they sell off stock shares</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:48">and that drives down the market.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:50">So what is causing all of this anxiety?</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:53">This is what a crash looks like,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="0:56">an oil market collapsed from $ 180 to 30 in just 18 months.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:02">To levels not seen since 2003.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:04">Where's the bottom, Morgan Stanley says $ 20,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:08">RVS says 16, standard charter 10.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:12">It's a boon for drivers, it acts as a tax break for consumers.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:16">But the force of the decline, so far, so fast</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:19">is destabilizing brining economic crisis to oil producers like Saudi Arabia,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:25">Venezuela, Russia, Nigeria, Iraq.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:27">Pink slips for energy workers and potential bankruptcy for oil companies.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:32">Four reasons why this is happening.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:34">First, OPEC won't cut production.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:36">The world's largest oil producers are holding out to see if other smaller producers will slow the pumps,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:41">hoping they can gain or keep their market share in the long run.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:44">But it's costing them billions, and Iran is about to start selling oil too.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:48">Second, China is spooking everyone,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:51">the world's second largest economy is slowing.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:53">It needs less fuel to run its economy,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:55">and the emerging market would be less as well.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="1:58">Third, The US is producing more oil than ever,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:01">largely created by American shale oil boom.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:04">And this plunge in prices hasn't shut out too many producers yet.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:08">And finally, the US dollar is strong, crude oil trades in dollars,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:12">that means when the dollar gets stronger,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:14">oil gets more expensive for over seas buyers.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:16">That hurts demand and drive prices down further.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:20">Mourning and defiance stretched across Indonesia yesterday.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:25">The island chains between the Indian and Pacific oceans</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:28">with 256 million people, it's the fifth most populated nation in the world</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:33">And the largest Muslim majority country.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:37">Yesterday, in the capital of Jakarta,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:39">terrorists using explosives and firearms targeted an area often visited by foreigners.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:45">At least two people were killed and 19 were wounded.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:49">Indonesian authorities place the blame on the ISIS terrorist group,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:52">and ISIS later claimed responsibility in an online statement.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:56">This happened two days after a bombing Istanbul,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="2:59">the largest city in Turkey, formerly named Constantinople.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:03">ISIS was blamed for that too,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:05">a suicide bombing that killed ten visiting Germans.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:08">Turkey's prime minister said his country would continue its fight against terrorism</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:13">and never take a step back.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:15">Turkey's a nation at a crossroads in more ways than its geographical location between Europe and Asia.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:22">Turkey faces a host of challenges that are likely to make 2016 a very difficult year.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:32">The government is simultaneously fighting</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:35">Kurdish militants from the Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:39">as well as ISIS militants.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:42">Score of people have died as a result of the Kurdish fighting</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:46">over the course of the last several months,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:48">and ISIS militants and suicide bombers are believed to have killed</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:52">around 130 Turkish citizens in a series of suicide bombings</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="3:57">in six months alone at the end of 2015.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:02">These civil war in neighboring Syria continues to spill over.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:06">Turkey's policy of accepting more than a million Syrian refugees</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:11">has been incredibly generous, but it has also changed</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:14">the demographics of Turkish cities and towns.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:17">There are now homeless Syrians struggling to eke out a living.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:23">Turkey's multi billion dollar tourism industry,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:27">which makes up a significant part of the entire economy</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:30">has suffered several blows.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:32">An important trading partner Russia has called for boycott of Turkish beaches and goods.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:37">After Turkish war planes shot down a Russian bomber</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:41">operating along the Turkish- Syrian border in November of 2015.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:47">That is likely to strike a major blown to the Turkish economy.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:53">A suicide bomber of suspected Syrian origin</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:56">has struck the jewel of the Turkish tourism industry.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="4:59">The ancient district of Sultanahmet in what was</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:03">the heart of the ancient city of Constantinople</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:06">and now one of the most frequented tourist destinations in all of Turkey.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:11">And amid the many challenges Turkey faces,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:14">it is perhaps more politically polarized than ever.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:17">With a population divided between those who love</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:21">and those who loath Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the current president of Turkey.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:26">A man who has dominated the political scene</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:29">in this country for some 14 years.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:35">All right, let's take role, now announcing three of the schools online this Friday.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:40">From Westphalia, Missouri, please welcome the Bulldogs.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:43">Thank you for watching form St. Joseph Catholic School.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:46">Chiefess Kamakahelei Middle School,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:49">is with us today, they're mascot the Pueo, their location</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:53">Lihue on the Hawaiian island of Kauai.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:55">And crossing southwest in the Pacific Ocean</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="5:58">we come to Kincoppal- Rose Bay, Sydney, Australia,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:01">is home to the School of the Sacred Heart.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:04">At what age is the human brain fully developed?</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:07">It's probably older that you think.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:10">Many experts say it's older than psychologists used to think.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:13">While the legal age of adulthood in the U. S. is 18 years,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:16">it seems the brain's ability to make well thought out decisions</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:20">may not be set until ten years after that.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:23">And once it's there, you have to keep learning to keep it there.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:26">Let's say this is the adolescent brain,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:29">It grew to this size by around age five or six.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:32">But that doesn't mean it's fully built.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:34">Think of it instead like a house that's been framed</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:36">but now needs the interior insulated.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:39">Our cells have a natural insulation called myelin.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:42">Brain cells have to build it and that takes years.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:45">In fact, the brain isn't fully myelinated and mature</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:48">until sometime in the late 20s.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:50">And here is the thing, this maturation begins at the back of the brain</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:53">and moves forward with the very last part of the brain to be fully connected and functional,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="6:58">being the frontal cortex.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:00">The very part of our brain that is our voice of reason</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:03">where we control our impulses and risk taking behavior.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:05">That develops last, even before puberty starts the preteen brain is growing grey matter right here in the cortex.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:12">That's at the highest rate since babyhood,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:14">the cortex is where thought and memory are based.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:16">That gives the preteen brain lots of synapses to use</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:20">or lose and lose they will, if they don't use it.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:24">The brain makes itself more efficient by cutting off those pathways</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:27">that aren't being developed.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:28">So think about it, if you're learning a new sport or a musical instrument,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:32">your brain is gonna save and keep those abilities.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:34">But if you're being a couch potato in front of the television, you get the idea.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:46">Before we go, a magnificent merging of music, luminance and technology.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:51">The players, 100 drones, people in machines to control them.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="7:55">One serious orchestra, and space in the sky near the German city of Hamburg.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="8:00">Computer sync the lights on the drones to the movement of the music.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="8:04">Its set a Guinness world of record for most drones in the sky at once</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="8:08">and light up the night Beethoven never would ever imagined when composing his fifth symphony.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="8:15">Not hard to see the highs and low notes in that performance.</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="8:18">And if we can float a few ideas for next time,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="8:20">they might consider WC's Claire de Drone,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="8:23">Strauss's Blue Dronube, Bach's Brendroneburg concertos,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="8:27">Brahm's Hungarian Drones or Mozart's magic flight,</a><a href="#" class="amara-transcript-line" title="8:31">we could drone on and on, that's CNN student news.</a>
